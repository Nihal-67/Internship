"I am writing this review after using this mobile phone for 2 days . First of all, I would like to thanks POCO for manufacturing this wonderful phone.Look : The design of the phone is quite attractive with a different back camera panel having a logo ""poco"" of the company. Body colour texture is excellent. It looks quite premium product. With a plastic back cover, there will be no fingerprint stick with your phone. Although, due to high capacity battery, you may feel little bit heavy on you...READ MORE",5

It's a value for money product.. But if you r a photography Anthusiast then this phone is definitely not for you.. Pubg works fine so you can play games no doubt. Battery is awesome. I deducted 1star only because in this price segment we might find better phones from realme.,4
This phone is pretty decentBattery backup and display quality is very good at this price rangeSpeacker sound quality is also goodPerformance is pretty fast .But only low and balance and high frame rate support on pubg.Camera quality is good.,4
I received my Poco M3 today (delivered by Ekart in 2 days). These are my first impressions.Design and build: Fits well in hand and it's side mounted finger print scanners ls also placed in an optimal location. A simple plastic back with curved edges.

"The phone is quite good and value for money.* Camera is kind of okay, can't complaint while considering the price.* Battery is above average, will stand for at least one and a half day for normal use. For heavy user's, I think it might stand for one day.* Display is IPS LCD display which work's very well and the quality is good for the price; also it is best display in among LCD .* Performance is satisfying, the Chipset handle's daily tasks smoothly and as this is a mid-range Chipset ...READ MORE",4
Thank you Flipkart for such a nice mobile in such a great deal. Phone camera performance is good i like it,3
"The phone looks like very good and also i liked the MI Launcher very much. But, other thinks are average.I didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor...The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger.When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal..I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3

"This is my geniune review with POCO M3.Basically I am a one plus 8 User and purchased M3 Just for its design. I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5
really liked this phone. Where is its people and it is very good in battery and its rate and everything is fine. But the little camera in it is not good. Still I think. Very good which performance is talked about. The ground is fine to a great extent.,5
"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.I had to reinstall th...READ MORE",4

Phone looks sturdy and the display is great...sound is the best thing about the phone...buttons are nicely placed. front camera is not so good..but back camera is nice. overall a nice phone,4
Excellent Phone total value for money camera is good display is excellent and battery is too good. Loved it....,5
After around 1 month of usage-Even though its a budget phone the intial days Mi Note 3 worked well than this. It sometimes get hanged and when I tried to download a 1 gb file from internet. It restarted itself.So performance wise not good.Nothing is great. Can't have a Google feed normally also.Feeling likw giving it back,2

"Selfie camera was 👎Respected buyers mobile outlook was fantastic , but if u want good camera quality don't buy these mobile..Camera quality was too lowDon't buy if u look good camera mobile",3
POCO M3 is good phone but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display is very bad many times its display gave the some issues. It is not even good for childrens.The processor ram and camera is very good but display is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app,1
If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Horrible phoneWhy?1-It heat up while charging and playing games2- Phone sensitive very less3- there's no hands free call in game turbo so it's a pain in the neck when call came while playing games4- 4GB ram works faster than this pathetic 6GB ram5- you cannot tap forward or backward while watching YouTube but have to drag the player every time which is disgusting6- battery never last as how it mention in the specification (4000 mah is better )and to fully charge it took almost 4 hou...READ MORE,1

Used it for 1 month and got all the features described... I am happy with this phone and if you are a fan of playing games like Free fire you should buy it.... 😁,4
"This phone is best phone underr 11,000 according to price its battery, display and smoothness is best.Camera is not so good because it has 48 +2+2 camera setup but it not feels like that it feels like only 20Mp. Poco has to improve this camera quality issue.. But rest of all things are best..",4

"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great.

Nice phone I have buy in my life. IT is a super phone. I had watched some reviews on Flipkart they are saying selfie camera is very poor but my Poco m3 has a funtastic selfie and back camera.In this price range it is a super phone.I am using it for 10 days and I am saying this review.Its performance is super,5

"My real review after 10 days of use-battery heat up more when it goes from 15 to 40 then normal heat up till 75. Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may. All over it is a good phone under 10,000.",4
"I am writing review after using phone for approximately 20 days.

"Very nice phone and the most best thing is that it is the best phone under 12000 whoever reads my coments, I suggests you to buy this phone by eyed closed. You cannot find such a good phone under 12k. Thanks.",5

I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.Camara is goodBattery is powerfulPerformance also goodAll the things is good not bestBut in this prize range it is best phone,5
"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

The mobile is really good... And dont expect a bomblastic camare from poco but overall its a decent phone at this price battery is good performance is good...pubg works smoothly thanks for snapdragon 665,4
It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3
"Poco m3 is good smartphone under 13k. If you are a student and buy for study, lectures classes then it is more comfortable smartphone. Battery life is also good. Good camera but brand should be mentioned the brand of camera sensor. Overall lovely performance...",4

"Considering the price, it's a very smart looking phone. Needed a phone for everyday use, and it does the job without any fuss. Need to install better sms apps though - google messaging is the default, and not very quick or easy to use",4

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

But, other thinks are average.I didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor...The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger.When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal..I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

First of all, I would like to thanks POCO for manufacturing this wonderful phone.Look : The design of the phone is quite attractive with a different back camera panel having a logo ""poco"" of the company.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Horrible phoneWhy?1-It heat up while charging and playing games2- Phone sensitive very less3- there's no hands free call in game turbo so it's a pain in the neck when call came while playing games4- 4GB ram works faster than this pathetic 6GB ram5- you cannot tap forward or backward while watching YouTube but have to drag the player every time which is disgusting6- battery never last as how it mention in the specification (4000 mah is better )and to fully charge it took almost 4 hou...READ MORE,1

"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2.

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1.

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"Phone is good in this budget and working fine in daily usage. With clean android experience and 90Hz refresh rate, the phone is way better than other brands (like redmi, realme, oppo etc. which are filled with bloatware) in this price range.",5
Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer. Big battery can be an excuse but still phone thickness will make you think twice before going for it.Processor is new brand (no SD or MT).. working smoothly so far without any lag.Sound quality is good,4

"This is my geniune review with POCO M3.Basically I am a one plus 8 User and purchased M3 Just for its design. I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5
really liked this phone. Where is its people and it is very good in battery and its rate and everything is fine. But the little camera in it is not good. Still I think. Very good which performance is talked about. The ground is fine to a great extent.,5
"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.I had to reinstall th...READ MORE",4

POCO M3 is good phone but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display is very bad many times its display gave the some issues. It is not even good for childrens.The processor ram and camera is very good but display is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app,1
If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer. Big battery can be an excuse but still phone thickness will make you think twice before going for it.Processor is new brand (no SD or MT).. working smoothly so far without any lag.Sound quality is good,4

But, other thinks are average.I didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor...The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger.When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal..I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5

So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1.

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5

Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base.

"This is my geniune review with POCO M3.Basically I am a one plus 8 User and purchased M3 Just for its design. I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5
really liked this phone. Where is its people and it is very good in battery and its rate and everything is fine. But the little camera in it is not good. Still I think. Very good which performance is talked about. The ground is fine to a great extent.,5
"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.I had to reinstall th...READ MORE",4

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2.

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1.

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month.

Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"Phone is good in this budget and working fine in daily usage. With clean android experience and 90Hz refresh rate, the phone is way better than other brands (like redmi, realme, oppo etc. which are filled with bloatware) in this price range.",5
Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer. Big battery can be an excuse but still phone thickness will make you think twice before going for it.Processor is new brand (no SD or MT).. working smoothly so far without any lag.Sound quality is good,4

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5

"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1.

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base.

"I am writing this review after using this mobile phone for 2 days . First of all, I would like to thanks POCO for manufacturing this wonderful phone.Look : The design of the phone is quite attractive with a different back camera panel having a logo ""poco"" of the company. Body colour texture is excellent. It looks quite premium product. With a plastic back cover, there will be no fingerprint stick with your phone.

Charger and phone heating is not normal..I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1.

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

"I am writing this review after using this mobile phone for 2 days . First of all, I would like to thanks POCO for manufacturing this wonderful phone.Look : The design of the phone is quite attractive with a different back camera panel having a logo ""poco"" of the company. Body colour texture is excellent. It looks quite premium product. With a plastic back cover, there will be no fingerprint stick with your phone.

Charger and phone heating is not normal..I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3

Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer. Big battery can be an excuse but still phone thickness will make you think twice before going for it.Processor is new brand (no SD or MT).. working smoothly so far without any lag.Sound quality is good,4

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great.

"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product.

"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great.

Nice phone I have buy in my life. IT is a super phone.

"My real review after 10 days of use-battery heat up more when it goes from 15 to 40 then normal heat up till 75. Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may. All over it is a good phone under 10,000.",4

I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.Camara is goodBattery is powerfulPerformance also goodAll the things is good not bestBut in this prize range it is best phone,5
"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

The mobile is really good... And dont expect a bomblastic camare from poco but overall its a decent phone at this price battery is good performance is good...pubg works smoothly thanks for snapdragon 665,4
It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3

Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer.

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great. Supports reverse charging but strangely we still get impure USB C cable & USB A charger, so one needs to buy & carry a pure USB C cable seperately.-Phone has good dece...READ MORE",4

"My real review after 10 days of use-battery heat up more when it goes from 15 to 40 then normal heat up till 75. Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may. All over it is a good phone under 10,000.",4

"Very nice phone and the most best thing is that it is the best phone under 12000 whoever reads my coments, I suggests you to buy this phone by eyed closed. You cannot find such a good phone under 12k. Thanks.",5
One of the best Smart Phone at this rate. I grabbed the best deal at this price.,5
I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.Camara is goodBattery is powerfulPerformance also goodAll the things is good not bestBut in this prize range it is best phone,5
"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion. And coming to ...READ MORE",4

The mobile is really good... And dont expect a bomblastic camare from poco but overall its a decent phone at this price battery is good performance is good...pubg works smoothly thanks for snapdragon 665,4
It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3
"Poco m3 is good smartphone under 13k. If you are a student and buy for study, lectures classes then it is more comfortable smartphone. Battery life is also good. Good camera but brand should be mentioned the brand of camera sensor. Overall lovely performance...",4

"Considering the price, it's a very smart looking phone. Needed a phone for everyday use, and it does the job without any fuss. Need to install better sms apps though - google messaging is the default, and not very quick or easy to use",4
"It's the perfect buy considering the qualities like processor(Snapdragon), which is good for gaming n all at such a cheap price.Also camera quality is best at this price",5

In this range we got this phone is really amazing performance and some features are really satisfied thank you flipkart for this awesome product,5
"The front camera is really really bad. The self image during video calls seems so weird that my iPhone 6s does a far better job.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great.

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good.

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base.

"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

"Very nice phone and the most best thing is that it is the best phone under 12000 whoever reads my coments, I suggests you to buy this phone by eyed closed. You cannot find such a good phone under 12k. Thanks.",5
One of the best Smart Phone at this rate. I grabbed the best deal at this price.,5
I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.Camara is goodBattery is powerfulPerformance also goodAll the things is good not bestBut in this prize range it is best phone,5
"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion. And coming to ...READ MORE",4

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3
"Poco m3 is good smartphone under 13k. If you are a student and buy for study, lectures classes then it is more comfortable smartphone. Battery life is also good. Good camera but brand should be mentioned the brand of camera sensor. Overall lovely performance...",4

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

"This is my geniune review with POCO M3.Basically I am a one plus 8 User and purchased M3 Just for its design. I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5
really liked this phone. Where is its people and it is very good in battery and its rate and everything is fine. But the little camera in it is not good. Still I think. Very good which performance is talked about. The ground is fine to a great extent.,5
"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.I had to reinstall th...READ MORE",4

POCO M3 is good phone but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display is very bad many times its display gave the some issues. It is not even good for childrens.The processor ram and camera is very good but display is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app,1
If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5

awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3

I don't know why company has claimed the camera is of 50 MP. It's as good as 20 MP only. Rest of the things are good but not according to price. In that case Samsung phones supersedes the realme with the same price. I am little disappointed to opt it.,3

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good.

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

"This phone is best phone underr 11,000 according to price its battery, display and smoothness is best.Camera is not so good because it has 48 +2+2 camera setup but it not feels like that it feels like only 20Mp. Poco has to improve this camera quality issue.. But rest of all things are best..",4

"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5

awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3

Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer.

POCO M3 is good phone but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display is very bad many times its display gave the some issues. It is not even good for childrens.The processor ram and camera is very good but display is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app,1
If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base.

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5
really liked this phone. Where is its people and it is very good in battery and its rate and everything is fine. But the little camera in it is not good. Still I think. Very good which performance is talked about. The ground is fine to a great extent.,5
"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

Gaming is ok . But u will feel the hd+ display and its a problemValue for money or not ? Yes it is",4
"Phone is good in this budget and working fine in daily usage. With clean android experience and 90Hz refresh rate, the phone is way better than other brands (like redmi, realme, oppo etc. which are filled with bloatware) in this price range.",5
Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer. Big battery can be an excuse but still phone thickness will make you think twice before going for it.Processor is new brand (no SD or MT).. working smoothly so far without any lag.Sound quality is good,4

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5
really liked this phone. Where is its people and it is very good in battery and its rate and everything is fine. But the little camera in it is not good. Still I think. Very good which performance is talked about. The ground is fine to a great extent.,5
"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.I had to reinstall th...READ MORE",4

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1.

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base.

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice.

"Very nice phone and the most best thing is that it is the best phone under 12000 whoever reads my coments, I suggests you to buy this phone by eyed closed. You cannot find such a good phone under 12k. Thanks.",5
One of the best Smart Phone at this rate. I grabbed the best deal at this price.,5
I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.Camara is goodBattery is powerfulPerformance also goodAll the things is good not bestBut in this prize range it is best phone,5
"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3

Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer.

I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.Display is really good in this price segment....READ MORE",5
really liked this phone. Where is its people and it is very good in battery and its rate and everything is fine. But the little camera in it is not good. Still I think. Very good which performance is talked about. The ground is fine to a great extent.,5
"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them.

Good to read ebooks, watching videos.- Plenty of useful modes such as reading mode, black and white mode, normal and ultra bettery saver mode which can save a lot of battery in case of traveling.- Best performance in normal use like watching YouTube video and Netflix...READ MORE",4

"Very nice phone and the most best thing is that it is the best phone under 12000 whoever reads my coments, I suggests you to buy this phone by eyed closed. You cannot find such a good phone under 12k. Thanks.",5
One of the best Smart Phone at this rate. I grabbed the best deal at this price.,5
I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.Camara is goodBattery is powerfulPerformance also goodAll the things is good not bestBut in this prize range it is best phone,5
"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion. And coming to ...READ MORE",4

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3
"Poco m3 is good smartphone under 13k. If you are a student and buy for study, lectures classes then it is more comfortable smartphone. Battery life is also good. Good camera but brand should be mentioned the brand of camera sensor. Overall lovely performance...",4

"Considering the price, it's a very smart looking phone. Needed a phone for everyday use, and it does the job without any fuss. Need to install better sms apps though - google messaging is the default, and not very quick or easy to use",4

Charger and phone heating is not normal..I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3

Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer. Big battery can be an excuse but still phone thickness will make you think twice before going for it.Processor is new brand (no SD or MT).. working smoothly so far without any lag.Sound quality is good,4

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great. Supports reverse charging but strangely we still get impure USB C cable & USB A charger, so one needs to buy & carry a pure USB C cable seperately.-Phone has good dece...READ MORE",4
Nice phone I have buy in my life. IT is a super phone. I had watched some reviews on Flipkart they are saying selfie camera is very poor but my Poco m3 has a funtastic selfie and back camera.In this price range it is a super phone.I am using it for 10 days and I am saying this review.Its performance is super,5
This product Better battery is Good nd only camera not good all are good,3
"My real review after 10 days of use-battery heat up more when it goes from 15 to 40 then normal heat up till 75. Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may. All over it is a good phone under 10,000.",4
"I am writing review after using phone for approximately 20 days. I am not a big game lover, so haven't played games on this device but performance wise there phone is excellent.Pros:- Excellent screen size and resolution. Good to read ebooks, watching videos.- Plenty of useful modes such as reading mode, black and white mode, normal and ultra bettery saver mode which can save a lot of battery in case of traveling.- Best performance in normal use like watching YouTube video and Netflix...READ MORE",4

"Very nice phone and the most best thing is that it is the best phone under 12000 whoever reads my coments, I suggests you to buy this phone by eyed closed. You cannot find such a good phone under 12k. Thanks.",5
One of the best Smart Phone at this rate. I grabbed the best deal at this price.,5
I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.Camara is goodBattery is powerfulPerformance also goodAll the things is good not bestBut in this prize range it is best phone,5
"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion. And coming to ...READ MORE",4

The mobile is really good... And dont expect a bomblastic camare from poco but overall its a decent phone at this price battery is good performance is good...pubg works smoothly thanks for snapdragon 665,4
It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3
"Poco m3 is good smartphone under 13k. If you are a student and buy for study, lectures classes then it is more comfortable smartphone. Battery life is also good. Good camera but brand should be mentioned the brand of camera sensor. Overall lovely performance...",4
Detailed Review after 10 day usePros-Look is awesome and fresh. The yellow colour comes out as very vibrant. The screen display too is very good. Though slightly low in bright sunlight.-Performance wise it works pretty well. No lag or hanging issue seen while playing games or using heavy apps-Wifi and network speed is very good-Power bckup even after heavy usage is excellent.-Rear camera does the job for you and gives pretty decent pictures.-Face unlock and finger print unlock works fa...READ MORE,5
"Considering the price, it's a very smart looking phone. Needed a phone for everyday use, and it does the job without any fuss. Need to install better sms apps though - google messaging is the default, and not very quick or easy to use",4
"It's the perfect buy considering the qualities like processor(Snapdragon), which is good for gaming n all at such a cheap price.Also camera quality is best at this price",5

Like 6 GB RAM, 6000 mh battery, 42 megapixel triple camera, good processer, game booster, side fingerprint, fast charger, mobile cover also added. Overall this is the best feature phone available in this Price range.",5
Phone is good but if camera would be more better than it will be very good. Only i am disappoint with the camera.. but other wise it is amons ter and good product in this price range.,4
"Mobile is absolutely fantastic and is best to buy if one's budget within 11k, overall performance is good along with a good battery life makes it really worth purchasing.",5
In this range we got this phone is really amazing performance and some features are really satisfied thank you flipkart for this awesome product,5
"The front camera is really really bad. The self image during video calls seems so weird that my iPhone 6s does a far better job. And I bought this phone as a secondary out of frustrating iphone battery and my eventual move to Android.Rest the battery, display , memory and performance is absolutely great.

"So here is the detailed simplest review pf my experience on poco M3I orderd the powerblack color with variant 6gb, 128GBAnd i feel like this is the best phone on this price range by these specs. 🤟The phone performance is pretty good.

"I am writing this review after using this mobile phone for 2 days . First of all, I would like to thanks POCO for manufacturing this wonderful phone.Look : The design of the phone is quite attractive with a different back camera panel having a logo ""poco"" of the company. Body colour texture is excellent. It looks quite premium product. With a plastic back cover, there will be no fingerprint stick with your phone.

It's a value for money product.. But if you r a photography Anthusiast then this phone is definitely not for you.. Pubg works fine so you can play games no doubt. Battery is awesome. I deducted 1star only because in this price segment we might find better phones from realme.,4

I received my Poco M3 today (delivered by Ekart in 2 days). These are my first impressions.Design and build: Fits well in hand and it's side mounted finger print scanners ls also placed in an optimal location. A simple plastic back with curved edges.

"The phone looks like very good and also i liked the MI Launcher very much. But, other thinks are average.I didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor...The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger.When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal..I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3

"Phone is good in this budget and working fine in daily usage. With clean android experience and 90Hz refresh rate, the phone is way better than other brands (like redmi, realme, oppo etc. which are filled with bloatware) in this price range.",5
Front camera is not as per standard. Back camera is good enough certainly not outstanding.Phone too thick compared to other new phones in the Market which are much slimmer. Big battery can be an excuse but still phone thickness will make you think twice before going for it.Processor is new brand (no SD or MT).. working smoothly so far without any lag.Sound quality is good,4

Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great.

The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good.

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4
"Excellent mobile at 11k with 6GB ram, 128 memory.Full HD display , smooth touch responseExcellent sound qualityLong battery back upNo lagging issue, smooth performance.Camera not upto the mark , rest all are good and well.",5
Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5

"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage.

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level.

If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2

Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI.

Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4

As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4
"Excellent mobile at 11k with 6GB ram, 128 memory.Full HD display , smooth touch responseExcellent sound qualityLong battery back upNo lagging issue, smooth performance.Camera not upto the mark , rest all are good and well.",5
Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great.

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may.

"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5

awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3

"Selfie camera was 👎Respected buyers mobile outlook was fantastic , but if u want good camera quality don't buy these mobile..Camera quality was too lowDon't buy if u look good camera mobile",3
POCO M3 is good phone but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display is very bad many times its display gave the some issues. It is not even good for childrens.The processor ram and camera is very good but display is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app,1
If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).This phone has the worst selfie cameraThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button,2
"All things are good, very affordable price in 6GB RAM -128 STORAGE, My Son Happy with it, all game run in mobile .longer battery, and very fast response to open application -worth it- only camera performance average.",5
"Best phone in this price... Awesome camera,performance,display.... Camera work best in 48 mp .....",5
Horrible phoneWhy?1-It heat up while charging and playing games2- Phone sensitive very less3- there's no hands free call in game turbo so it's a pain in the neck when call came while playing games4- 4GB ram works faster than this pathetic 6GB ram5- you cannot tap forward or backward while watching YouTube but have to drag the player every time which is disgusting6- battery never last as how it mention in the specification (4000 mah is better )and to fully charge it took almost 4 hou...READ MORE,1

Used it for 1 month and got all the features described... I am happy with this phone and if you are a fan of playing games like Free fire you should buy it.... 😁,4
"This phone is best phone underr 11,000 according to price its battery, display and smoothness is best.Camera is not so good because it has 48 +2+2 camera setup but it not feels like that it feels like only 20Mp. Poco has to improve this camera quality issue.. But rest of all things are best..",4
"Review after 40 daysBest phone if u r more of a streaming user than a gaming user...!!I bought this for my father who only uses this for the basics, whatsapp & youtube..All i wanted was 128gb int., A big drainless battery with fast charger included & killer looks...Poco M3 provided these 3 within 11.5k is a pretty good deal..As i said if u r a mediocre user as above mentioned, this is best for u...Bt if u dont much care about looks & instead looking for something more ...READ MORE",4
"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.Con:1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4

Date of review: 11/05/2021(I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.Pros:1. Best battery backup2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k3. ...READ MORE,4
Two biggest cons:-1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.2) Camera is pathetic.PROS:-1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.3) Battery life is too good.4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.,4
Bought this one for normal use and its Great.Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.Display is also good produces good colours.U can do Gaming on this one...READ MORE,4
"Writing after using for 10 days.-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great.

Then no heat up.Front camera is not good but ok, back is very good.It have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.If you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may. All over it is a good phone under 10,000.",4

I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.Camara is goodBattery is powerfulPerformance also goodAll the things is good not bestBut in this prize range it is best phone,5
"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.1.The camera is awesome2.The battery life is so good3.The performance is nice4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5

awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...READ MORE",3
"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3
"I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level. Battery is also good if ur okay with the medium paced charging, lasts long for an avg user. Camera is horrible.overall a good buy for very specific users.",3

You can also track you sleep records.There are lots of features in this watch even it reminds you to drink water, relax and sit down, start exercise etc. I love it.Battery is also good 🙂",5
"Pros.1. Build quality is good .ConsSmall range.Software needs an upgrade.The mobile interface they provide doesn't work well everytime(5 out of 10) . Sometimes even less than it's competitors models , it doesn't give out the notification accordingly.",3
Its a comfortable watch. I bought for my fatherThe heart rate sensor is mostly accurate but not 100% obviously. Spo2 meter works fine. overall good value proposition,4

You can also track you sleep records.There are lots of features in this watch even it reminds you to drink water, relax and sit down, start exercise etc. I love it.Battery is also good 🙂",5
"Pros.1. Build quality is good .ConsSmall range.Software needs an upgrade.The mobile interface they provide doesn't work well everytime(5 out of 10) . Sometimes even less than it's competitors models , it doesn't give out the notification accordingly.",3
Its a comfortable watch. I bought for my fatherThe heart rate sensor is mostly accurate but not 100% obviously. Spo2 meter works fine. overall good value proposition,4
